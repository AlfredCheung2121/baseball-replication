    "text": "This chart displays the distribution of MLB games across different temperature ranges from 1950 to 2021, revealing a clear preference for moderate to warm playing conditions. The data shows that baseball games are most frequently played in temperatures between 65-80°F, with the peak occurring in the 70-75°F range at over 22,000 games. Game frequency drops significantly at temperature extremes, with very few games played below 45°F or above 95°F, reflecting both player comfort and fan attendance considerations.\n\n\nWarning: One or more parsing issues, call `problems()` on your data frame for details,\ne.g.:\n  dat &lt;- vroom(...)\n  problems(dat)\n\n\nRows: 132649 Columns: 110\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (12): day, day_night, park_id, hm_tm, hm_tm_lg, vis_tm, vis_tm_lg, cove...\ndbl  (94): dbl_hdr, attendance, duration, hm_runs, vis_runs, vis_hr, vis_k, ...\nlgl   (1): completion\ndate  (2): date, end\ntime  (1): imputed_start_hour\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nWarning: `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\nℹ Please use a list of either functions or lambdas:\n\n# Simple named list: list(mean = mean, median = median)\n\n# Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: tibble::lst(mean, median)\n\n# Using lambdas list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nWarning: There were 5712 warnings in `summarise()`.\nThe first warning was:\nℹ In argument: `day = mean(day, na.rm = TRUE)`.\nℹ In group 1: `month = 3` `year = 1996`.\nCaused by warning in `mean.default()`:\n! argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\nℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 5711 remaining warnings."
