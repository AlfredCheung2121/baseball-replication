    "text": "This chart displays the distribution of MLB games across different temperature ranges from 1950 to 2021, revealing a clear preference for moderate to warm playing conditions. The data shows that baseball games are most frequently played in temperatures between 65-80°F, with the peak occurring in the 70-75°F range at over 22,000 games. Game frequency drops significantly at temperature extremes, with very few games played below 45°F or above 95°F, reflecting both player comfort and fan attendance considerations."
